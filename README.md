## Details

This project uses Angular(11.x.x) and TensorFlow(2.x.x) and CNN(Convolution Neural Network) architecture and trained on MNIST Dataset.

## Folder :octocat:

There are basically 2 types of Folder one is Client(Browser) other one is Server. Client folder consist of angular files responsible of UI. Server folder has files to load TensorFlow model and predict on Node JS. I recommend to use a umbrella folder structure. A parent folder with project name and inside it client folder, server folder.

## Clone

Use git clone to clone Client Side code `https://github.com/shba007/Digit-Recognizer-Client.git` and Server side code `https://github.com/shba007/Digit-Recognizer-Server.git`

## Deploy :rocket:

The Client deployed in the Netlify platform check out the link [Digit Recognizer](https://digit-recognizer-ai.netlify.app)

## Conclusion

If you like the project give it a star :star:
